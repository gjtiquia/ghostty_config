# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# (GJ) 
#
# (GJ) Hot Keys
# Ctrl Shift , = reload config
# Ctrl Shift i = toggle [i]nspector 
# Ctrl Enter = fullscreen (different from maximized window)
#
# (GJ) Config

# themes and fonts

# these theme names are no longer working
# theme = tokyonight
# theme = catppuccin-frappe
# theme = rose-pine
# theme = rose-pine-moon
# theme = rose-pine-dawn
# theme = "light:rose-pine-dawn, dark:rose-pine-moon"

# theme = Rose Pine Dawn
# theme = Rose Pine Moon
theme = "light:Rose Pine Dawn, dark:Rose Pine Moon"

font-family = "FiraMono Nerd Font Mono"

# removes thick GNOME title bar
# but also removes ability to drag terminal around and resize
# but fullscreen will auto hide title bar anyways (maximized window is different from fullscreen btw)

window-theme = ghostty

# makes tmux extend all the way to the bottom of the screen
